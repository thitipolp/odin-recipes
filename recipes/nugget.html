    <p>Here's the secret to making the famous McNugget. Now that you know, I'll have to kill you...</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add your chicken, salt and one egg in a food processor. Blend until the mixture looks like a paste.</li>
        <li>Place the corn starch in a bowl. With wet hands, shape a handful of the mixture into a nugget.</li>
        <li>Dip the nuggets into the corn starch and place it on a lined baking sheet.</li>
         <li>In a large bowl, combine the water, one egg, mustard, spices and flour.</li>
         <li>Place the nuggets in the batter and place back onto the baking sheet.</li>
          <li>Place the sheet in the freezer and allow them to freeze for 1 hour.</li> 
         <li>Heat your oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Deep fry the first batch for 5 minutes. </li>
         <li>Allow the nuggets to drain on paper towel and deep fry again for 5 minutes. This helps the chicken cook through without burning it.</li>
          <li>Serve the nuggets with a sauce of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
